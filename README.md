# Vision processing for First Deep Space 2019

Team 5553 Robo'Lyon vision code running on a raspberry for First Deep Space.

This repository is based on the [LyonVision Template repository](https://github.com/Team5553-RoboLyon/LyonVision-Template).


## Getting started

### With your computer

1. Install [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases)

2. Install [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html)

3. Install a compiler
    - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/downloads/) on Windows (in the Visual Studio Installer program, choose "Desktop Developement in C++")
    - Gcc on Linux

4. Install the raspbian cross-compiler
    - Run the following command in the root directory of this project :
    ```bash
    .\gradlew installRaspbianToolchain
    ```

### With the Raspberry Pi

1. Grab the custom Raspberry Pi image from the [LyonVision-pi-gen repository](https://github.com/Team5553-RoboLyon/LyonVision-pi-gen/releases)
    - Latest release with name `LyonVision n°x - date`

2. Flash the image onto a microSD card using etcher: https://etcher.io/
    - You will need to grab the .img file from the zip. The .img file is what you give to etcher.
    - After complete, insert the microSD card and startup the coprocessor. It may take a minute or two.

3. Start your Raspberry Pi
    - Hostname: `lyonvision.local`
    - Username: `vision`
    - Password: `lyon`


## Usage

### Running your code locally on your computer :
```bash
.\gradlew runVision
```

### Deploying your code to the Raspberry Pi
```bash
.\gradlew deploy
```

### Build all
```bash
.\gradlew build
```

### Test code
```bash
.\gradlew check
```


## Git Submodule

The folder `src/lib/` is a git submodule. It is a link to the [Team5553-RoboLyon/LyonVision-Library](https://github.com/Team5553-RoboLyon/LyonVision-Library) repo where the pseudo-library files are located. These files are in a separated repository because there can be used by several projects.
